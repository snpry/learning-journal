# Sorting Algorithms

Here are some sorting algorithms that I've learned:

## Insertion Sort

### Description
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Start with the second element of the array.
2. Compare it to the first element.
3. Insert it into the correct position.
4. Repeat for all elements.

### Code Example
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
